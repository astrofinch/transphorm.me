TRANSPHORM.ME
=============

Transphorm.me is an online community that helps members make changes to their
lives, and keep track of them in a rewards-driven programme.

Friends and relatives can offer encouragement and comment through the member's
Logbook, which the member is asked to update, with frequent emails.

Members can create milestones to help keep them focused, and setup rewards to
keep them motivated.

The site works on a system of "goals", ie: "stop smoking". A new user picks a
goal from the dropdown list on the homepage. If one doesn't already exist, they
can create one by typing in its name, then filling in some more details, along
with a username and password (which they create on the same form).

DEVELOPMENT FEATURES
====================

- Sophisticated and simple signup process
- User is guided through setting up their goal
- Nightly cron job to email members when required
- Anti-spam safeguards
- Google Charts integration, to show progress in a visual form
- Privacy controls: profiles can be made private, so the member can track
  their progress without any other members seeing their content

INSTALLATION
============

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

That should install the necessary Python libraries (Django [of course],
Markdown, pygooglechart and a graphics library called Grapefruit).

Copy settings_local.py.sample to settings_local.py, and rig up your
database. Everything works fine with SQLite.

Share and enjoy.
